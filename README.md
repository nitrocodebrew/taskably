# Taskably

My "flagship" React application. This project is the one that really helped me understand some core
React functionalities and principles when I initially started learning the library. This app has and
will see many different states (no pun intended) as development progresses. As of this writing, I'm still
very much learning new "tricks" and techniques to improve upon, so please, bear with me, if you will.
Everyone starts somewhere.
